# Data Provider for React Admin and Genezio

About genezio: https://genezio.com/

About React Admin: https://marmelab.com/react-admin/


Using this data provider, each react resource is mapped to a Genezio class. The Genezio classes have to implement the expected functions as explained in [this interface](https://github.com/bogdanripa/react-admin-genezio/blob/main/server/data-provider.ts)

See a demo and the code behind in [this repo](https://github.com/bogdanripa/react-admin-genezio).

# Data Provider for React Admin and Genezio

About Genezio: https://genezio.com/

About React Admin: https://marmelab.com/react-admin/


Using this data provider, each react resource is mapped to a Genezio class. The Genezio classes have to implement the expected functions as explained in [this interface](https://github.com/Genez-io/react-admin-genezio/blob/main/example/server/DataProvider.ts)

See the code behind and step-by-step instructions on how to deploy this data provider in the [example](https://github.com/Genez-io/react-admin-genezio/tree/main/example) folder.

And a working demo of this implementation: https://amethyst-vulnerable-pheasant.app.genez.io/

This is a serverless backend implementation using genezio classes and functions (FaaS or Functions as a Service)
